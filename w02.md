# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [How to Choose a Password - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg)<br>
This video is about how to create/choose a **password**, a **good one**. Two main things that I got from this video is our password should be long enough and make sure it's not [dictionary attacked](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/dictionary-attack) in order to avoid brute-forced. Very interesting topic and definitely worth to checkout.

2. [What is the Difference Between Protection and Security](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-protection-and-security/)<br>
This is an article about difference between **protection** and **security**, which sounds similiar for me.I get to know that the main difference is in the **environment**, which *protection* involves in the **internal** and *security* involves in the **external** threats to a computer system. Many other key differences explained in this article which makes it worth to read.

3. [Google Data Center Security: 6 Layers Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd33UVZhnAA)<br>
This is a video about Google Data Center Security, which shows on how Google protects their data. From **physical** to **application** security, I get to know on how a security system works in real life generally. Through their 6 layers of security, I learnt that Google didn't hold back about it and we, as an user, probably shouldn't as well. 

4. [Why You Should Turn On Two Factor Authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGRii5f_uSc)<br>
This video taught me about authentication factor, which is a security (authentication) method that is used to **verify** the **identity** and **authorization** of a user attempting to access a network, system or application. Two Factor Authentication (2-FA) comes from Multi Factor Authentication, which consist of *something you know* (passwords), *something you are* (biometrics, fingerprint), and *something you have* (cards, phone). In short, 2-FA is a must to make things more secure. Very interesting video which provides information and unique *war backstory* that involves authentication factor. 

5. [What is Cryptography? – An Introduction to Cryptographic Algorithms](https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-cryptography/)<br>
This article is about *Cryptography* in general. From this article, Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries. Besides definition, this article contains algorithms and how its working. They also provide video that is worth to check out.

6. [DDoS Attack Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilhGh9CEIwM)<br>
Have you ever play online games and at one point the game just decided to lag? Well I've experience those multiple times, especially in a team game where once me with a team played really well against our opponents. But suddenly, our peformance got interrupted because the game is lagging. We often joke it as a "DDoS-ing" because how funny it is the opponents got upset, so they attack "our computer" *(making the game lag)* in order to make us play badly. But is it really the "DDoS Attack" we meant for?

Fulfilling my curiousity, I found this video and get to learn how *DDoS* works, which is a **security threat** that interrupt operation of services by sending fraudulent data to the server from **multiple sources**, making its server overwhelm and its *normal user* gets denied. The video gave me a very clear explanation to catch on.

7. [This Video Is Sponsored By ███ VPN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY)<br>
In these era, 2020 and 2021 to be exact, many videos on YouTube post advertisment about this *Virutal Private Network*. These VPN advertisement claimed to give many beneficial things for its user, but is it really the truth they're claiming is? This video explain about it and clarify things around it, which makes it interesting.

8. [Belajar Memakai GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG/GPG)](https://medium.com/kode-dan-kodean/belajar-memakai-gnu-privacy-guard-gnupg-gpg-3944e19dba91)<br>
This article is about GnuPG and how to use it. The first few sections defines what GnuPG is, which is a application used to **encrpyt & decrpyt** data and creating **digital signature**. The other sections is about the explanation on how to use it. It is very, very depth, which I haven't use it to the fullest, but might be useful if you're interested more about it. This article comes in *Bahasa*, which is very helpful aswell for my *mother tounge*.

9. [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)<br>
This is a website that lists top 10 most critical **security risks to web applications**. I found it back in the day I took PPW course, which was being discussed back then. The website is informative and relevant since it keeps updating its list from years to years. Besides that, the organization behind it is very open-minded in order to improve the security of software. You might found other thing useful in this web.

10. [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)<br>
This is a website that **analyze** suspicious files and URLs to detect types of **malware**. It works by inspecting the item with many *antivirus scanners* and *domain blacklisting services*. You just have to submit file/URLs you want to check through the 'search box', and keep in mind that the submitted file/URLs are shared among its community in order to comment or vote on particular submission wheter it's safe or not.
