# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Where did Bytes Come From? – Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJCo0cyAuA)<br>
This is a YouTube video about the **origins of bytes**. *Why does 1 byte come with 8-bit?* Back in the days, computers were word-based. Since word-based consumed more power and it wasted some of bits that was not being used on early days of number computation, IBM decided to suggest a standardization of bytes, that comes with 8-bit, which then become an acceptable standard for computing back then.

2. [C - Pointers](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers)<br>
*To understand pointer, you must first understand pointer.* Jokes aside, I haven’t studied C before this OS course, so this website is perfect for those who don’t really know or forget about **pointer**, as it explains the **definition**, **usability**, and **implementation** example of pointer.


3. [Uses for multiple levels of pointer dereferences?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/758673/uses-for-multiple-levels-of-pointer-dereferences)<br>
This is a website explaining a question that I’ve been asking to myself when reading this week course material about pointers. What’s the **purpose** of pointer of pointer of pointer **(multiple pointers)?** There are quite useful answers about it. One of the answer *To become a [three star programmer](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreeStarProgrammer)* got to my attention.


4. [Endianness Explained With an Egg – Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>
This is a YouTube video explaining about endian number, consisting of **Big and Little endian**. First time of knowing this is when I was taking *Introduction to Digital System* course. It’s quite hard to distinguish both back then. Not until now, where Dr. Steve Bagley explain them with an **egg analogy**, which making me more understandable to differentiate it. In this video, Dr. Steve also explains behind the reason of these two endian concepts exist.


5. [Memory Management in OS: Contiguous, Swapping, Fragmentation](https://www.guru99.com/os-memory-management.html)<br>
This website is explaining **memory management**, from definition to techniques. It also provides other explanation about this week course, such as *swapping*, *memory allocation*, *paging*, and so on which makes this website quite complete, yet briefly explained.


6. [Difference between physical/logical/virtual memory address](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15851225/difference-between-physical-logical-virtual-memory-address)<br>
This website explains the **difference** between **physical, logical, and virtual** memory address, as I came across these terms in this week material. Turns out, these memory addresses play a role in memory management of a computer system.


7. [Virtual Memory: 5 Page Tables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNUJhZCQZ9c)<br>
This is a YouTube video explaining about **page tables**. There are lots of terms that I haven’t heard of in this video, but the way the presenter explains is good that I got rough idea about it, such as *why does it called ‘page tables’*, *what does page tables serve for*, and others.


8. [Linux Basics: Static Libraries vs. Dynamic Libraries](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)<br>
This is an article about **Linux Libraries** in general. It also explains the **difference** between **static and dynamic libraries**, from its **advantages and disadvantages**. It also provides the **creation** of library, which I think could be useful. Personally, this article is comprehensive but requires to login. I found [alternative article](https://medium.com/@StueyGK/static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-af78f0b5f1e4) if you guys are too lazy to login, but it still explaining the same thing.


9. [32 bit vs 64 bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu2A4fpFzgs)<br>
I’ve come across **32 and 64-bit architecture** when reading OSC chapter 9, where it’s explaining about its *segmentation, paging architecture,* and such. This got me curious on what these architecture offers regarding to its difference. Provided with animated illustration, this video explains very good and clear.


10. [Apple Goes ARM: The RISC Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtYfTVksuio)<br>
There’s an ongoing hype regarding to Apple’s CPU transition on its desktops and laptops, from Intel to Apple-designed chips based on **ARM64 architecture**. Rumors says it’s going to offer better performance and better power consumption. But what’s ARM really is? Well, this video perfectly explains it, and some of **historical background** between ARM and Apple itself.
