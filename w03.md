3. [What is a File Format?](https://youtu.be/VVdmmN0su6E)<br>
Have you ever tried to open a file that can't be opened because your computer couldn't **identify** what type of program is needed to open it? I do. *"Computer so stupid la, cannot open this."* said my little self. Apperently, it's not computer fault since my knowledge isn't that big back then (until now). But, it is related to *file format*. File can be opened depends on **how we decide** to open (read) it. Through this video, I get to learn the **concept** behind it. It might confusing, but this video also provide *unique* analogy that I think it's worth to check out.

4. [What are Drive Partitions?](https://youtu.be/AeUM4kR67XQ)<br>
This YouTube video explains what is **_drive partitioning_** and how does it *works*. Basically, partition helps the **allocation** of our stored data by **seperating** our physical hard drive into some **volumes**. From keeping our data **safe** from OS failure, to **improving** hard drive's performance by its [short-stroking technology](http://recoverymonkey.org/2012/07/24/what-is-hard-disk-short-stroking/), it seems that drive partition is a must! Well, not really. Turns out there's also disadvantages, which makes this video worth to check out.

5. [Linux File System/Structure Explained!](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
Do you know where Linux system located? Have you ever wondered ~~your life decision~~ where are your files installed in Linux? Do you find Linux confusing? Well fear not, because this YouTube video explains it! This is a very **good and useful** video about **Linux file system and structure**. It pretty much covered essential things about it. <br><br>
Intimidated by the video's length? Well, I've got the shorter version of the video which you can check it out as well: [Linux Directories Explained in 100 Seconds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4)

6. [Linux, Mac OS, Unix: File Permissions and User Classes](https://devtidbits.com/2012/07/01/linux-file-permissions-and-user-classes/)<br>
This website is an article about **Linux system file information**. Personally when I'm using Linux, I got confused many times seeing file information details, those "rwxr-xr-x" thingy. *What does that even mean?* Well, this article explains about it, and other things related about it which you guys might find it useful.

7. [Free space management in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
This is an article on how operating system manages spaces and maintains its free one. Provided with images, I get to know the basic concept on the system's implementation towards managing space. 

8. [Why You Can't Name A File CON In Windows](https://youtu.be/bC6tngl0PTI)<br>
This is a YouTube video which tells an *unique* story about **file naming restriction**. As it said on the title, *Windows* restricts its user to give these *unique names* explained in the video to a file. Why you may ask? Short answer, it's related to **_backwards compatibility_** on *Windows*. Long answer, go watch the video. It's a very interesting one.

9. [Why Progress Bars Don't Move Smoothly ▓▓▓░░░░░░](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZnLZFRylbs)<br>
**Progress bars**, I've seen those mostly in *computer-related* things. One ocassion for instance is when I'm trying to *copy-paste* some files to another drive, which then gives me a progress bar on a window, telling me how much time left does it takes to copy. For me, sometimes *the bar* is telling the truth, sometimes it don't. Besides, *the bar* didn't move smoothly, making me unsure if the file copied successfully. *Why does it can't, I wonder?*<br><br>
Well, this YouTube video explains it clearly and answers my curiosity. In *short*, it's because how **different** the proccess is take on different files and machines. 

10. [Compression - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lto-ajuqW3w)<br>
This is a YouTube video which talks about **compression**, brought by Professor David Brailsford. Through his explanation, I got the idea that compression works because of **familiarity**, which is useful to reduce the same process by *replicating* the same thing, reducing the final product size. The topic is relevant and I really like how Professor explains how compression works with examples, which helps my understanding.
