# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [What is meant by CPU Burst and I/O Burst?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)<br>
In CPU scheduling, there is a basic concept which tells that its execution involves cycles, **CPU and I/O burst**. At first glance, I'm not really sure what both terms mean. Turns out it rather simple, just like the answer explained, which helps me understand more about CPU scheduling concept.

2. [What is a Process in Operating System and what are the different states of a Process?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-a-process-in-operating-system-and-what-are-the-different-states-of-a-process)<br>
CPU scheduling takes place when there's a **process** such as _waiting to ready_, _running to waiting_, _running to ready_, and _process terminates_. This website **explains those process states** and other states aswell. I really like how the website define each state and provide picture and explanation on the process flow.

3. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
This is a website thath explains the **difference** between **Preemptive** and **Non-Preemptive** scheduling. One of the key difference is the fact that non-preemptive needs to **complete a process** to move to another, while preemptive processes **divide its process** time with CPU cycle so there will be process that needs to hold on if the burst time exceeding CPU. I really like the website provides comparison table to help me distinguish both terms easier.

4. [Operating System Scheduling algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
A **cheat sheet** for **scheduling algorithms** that exists. The algorithms explained in _"poin-poin"_, rather than a long text which helps me point out the **difference** between and there's also example on how to **count wait time** of each algorithms. Overall, a very good cheat sheet.

5. [Cooperative vs. Preemptive: a quest to maximize concurrency power](https://medium.com/traveloka-engineering/cooperative-vs-preemptive-a-quest-to-maximize-concurrency-power-3b10c5a920fe)<br>
In this article, one part that I've found interesting for me is on **Cooperative vs. Preemptive scheduling**. It explains **preemptive scheduling** that not only to be seen in OS, but in **real life application**. There's also several parts about **Threading model** and it's relation with scheduling. Even though it's a advanced article, I think it's worth to check out.

6. [Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm with Example](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
One of scheduling algorithm that I'm having quite hard time to understand it is **Round Robin**. This website explains it very depth, from its **definition** to its **advantage & disadvantage**. I also think that **step-by-step example** really helpful to become understand.

7. [Multiple Processor Systems - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/3RvkfuXUv1c)<br>
This is a YouTube video that explains what **multiple processor** system **looks and works** like. Is multiple processor brings **more advantages** than single one? What are the **motivation** behind multiple processor? All of these question answered in this video, implicitly. I really enjoy watching it and it's explained nicely.

8. [Affinity dan Load Ballancing](http://ftp.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-1/ch15s04.html)<br>
This is a website that explains about **affinity and load balancing**, that plays part in multiple processor scheduling. It's explained **briefly in Indonesia**, making easier for me to read on. Also, there are other materials that related to multiple processor system which you guys could explore.

9. [Computer System Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So9SR3qpWsM)<br>
This is a YouTube video that explains every **computer system architecture** that's avaliable. It also mention **Symmetric and Asymmetric Multiprocessing**. In that part, it's explained briefly (2 minutes) with diagram schema, making it more understandable.

10. [Process State Models in Operating System](https://slaystudy.com/process-state-models-in-operating-system/)<br>
Besides process state definition, there's also **its model**. In this website, you get to learn different **kinds of state process model**, up to seven state process model. Every model representated with diagram which helps to understand even more.
