# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Memory & Storage: Crash Course Computer Science #19](https://youtu.be/TQCr9RV7twk)<br>
This is a YouTube video that explains **computer memory and storage**. The topic that being discussed here ranging from how memory and storage **works together** in computer, **kinds of memory/storage**, to the **historic background** on these computer parts. The video presentation is very good, making it more interesting to watch.

2. [How a Hard Disk Drive Works](https://youtu.be/NtPc0jI21i0)<br>
This is another video explaining on **how hard disk drive works**. It gives depth explanation on **each part functionality** that hard disk have and **how those parts combined** together and run through **specfic processes**, making it works. The way the expert explains and how the video presented with real parts and diagram representation making this video a good one to watch, though it's quite hard for me to understand them all.

3. [Tape Drives As Fast As Possible](https://youtu.be/PnFbmqHkjGQ)<br>
Again, another YouTube video that explain about **tape drives**, one of computer storage that ever existed. It surprised me the fact that tape drive came in form of **old cassette thingy** that only play music. Turns out, many people used it for **data backups** even until now. Besides explaining on **how does it works**, they also explain what are the **advantages** does tape drives offer compared to HDDs and SSDs. Interesting topic explained briefly, which is very recommendable to watch.

4. [How Old School Floppy Drives Worked](https://youtu.be/EHRc-QMoUE4)<br>
Another YouTube video again (yay) about **floppy disk/drives**. I'm not born in these era where people mostly use floppy disk back then, so I'm curious about it. From explaining **what kinds of floppy disk**, to how does **each individual parts works** in floppy disk, I would say this video is very good for people who wants to know about it.

5. [HDD vs SSD - What is the difference?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4ykrNhI5xk)<br>
This is, *bear with me*, another YouTube video that explains the **difference between HDD and SSD**. My knowledge about this thing is only one, *SSD is much more faster than HDD*. Surely there's other thing into it right? **Parts**, **builds**, and even the **name origins** represent the drives. The way the difference explained makes this video a good one, and could be useful for specific person.

6. [Chapter 4. Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)](https://web.mit.edu/rhel-doc/5/RHEL-5-manual/Deployment_Guide-en-US/ch-raid.html)<br>
This is a wesbite that serves information about **RAID**. What RAID does is **combining small, inexpensive** disk drive to achieve performance, such **enhances speed**, **increase storage** capacity using a single virtual disk, and **minimizes disk failure**. I really like the simplicity of this website as it divides information into subchapter, making it easier to access and read on.

7. [MBR VS GPT | What's the Difference and Which Is Better](https://www.easeus.com/partition-master/mbr-vs-gpt.html)<br>
This is an article that explains **GPT & MBR scheme on disk partitioning**. The main difference between these two partition based on **boot mode** and **compatibility**. You can find the rest of the difference in this article, as I think its provide clearly. I really like they way they provide graphical diagram as the example of partition.

8. [What is network-attached storage?](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/network-attached-storage)<br>
This is a website explaining what is **Network Attached Storage (NAS)** and what does it serves purpose for. In short, is a storage that gives networks a **single access point for storage** with built-in security, management, and fault tolerant capabilities. This website gives information about NAS **definition**, how does it **works**, its benefit, and its **comparison** between other storages types, which I think makes this website good for its comprehensive information.

9. [PC BIOS Settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezubjTO7rRI)<br>
This is a YouTube video (yes, again) that's about **Basic Input Output System (BIOS)**. This video contains pretty much every general thing you need to know about it, as it explains **BIOS definition**, **BIOS types** (Legacy & UEFI) and differences, and even a step by step **guide on how to access the BIOS**. It's so complete that I think it's worth rewatching if you have any problems with your computer related to OS that requires BIOS access.

10. [What happens when you switch on a computer?](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/bootup.html)<br>
This is a website (or more like a question-answer article) that I've come across when searching about **Boot Loader**. I think this question is rather unique as probably no one ever wondered what does computer exactly do when we switch it on. You should check it out as it's quite interesting for me.
