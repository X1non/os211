# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Introduction to semaphores in C](https://youtu.be/YSn8_XdGH7c)<br>
This is a YouTube video explaining the **basic concept of semaphores**. Learning semaphore in the first place got me confused on several cases such as *"What happen if I call post() first instead of wait()? Is it possible to call wait() at the same time?"* and so on. Luckily, this video **explains very well** and provides **graphical representation** which really helps me understand the basic of semaphores and answers those questions. A very good video that is worth to check out!

2. [Multithreading Code - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/7ENFeb-J75k)<br>
This is the same YouTube video from Week 06 about **Multithreading**. I'm putting the same video because of how good it is. In the later half of the video, we get to learn one of the solution dealing with critical-section problem, which is **Mutex**. Mutex or **Mutex Locks** is one of sync tools that acts like a **token** in order to make sure there's only **one process (that holds the token) between multiple threads**. The way Dr. Steve explains it is very **clear and unique**, which helps me understand even more about it.

3. [Dining Philosophers Problem with Solution](https://youtu.be/NbwbQQB7xNQ)<br>
This is a YouTube video explaining about **Dining Philosophers**, one of synchronization problem. The explanation is understandable and it's explaining the way **Deadlock** can occurs in the problem. Besides that, it's provided with solution as well which is helpful.

4. [Race Conditions and Critical Sections](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html)<br>
This is a website providing information about **Race Condition & Critical Section**. These two are problems that can happen in synchronization. When first learning these terms, I thought that both are pretty much the same. Turns out it doesn't (obviously), but at least both are **related**. The website explains very depth and provided with examples which is helping me to understand. It

5. [Contrasting Peterson’s and Dekker’s algorithms](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12621/contrasting-peterson-s-and-dekker-s-algorithms)<br>
This is a website that answers **difference** between **Peterson's and Dekker's algorithms** in dealing with *critical section problem*. I've found that both solution looks quite similar that both process are **taking turns by sending a signal** when the first thread trying to do process. Turns out there's a difference in the **processes's behaviour**, a rather interesting difference for me to read on.

6. [Starvation and Fairness](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/starvation-and-fairness.html)<br>
This is a website that provides information about **Starvation and Fairness**. *Starvation* is an event that occurs in multiple threads that there's one thread getting all of CPU time, leaving the other thread **starved to death** not getting CPU time. *Fairness* is the solution of it. This website explains the **cause of starvation** and the **fairness implemenation** example in Java. Its explanation is very good to be read and its example could be useful as well.

7. [Introduction to DEADLOCK in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>
This is a website explaining about **Deadlock**, an event when multiple process **waiting each other** to be process, creating a **circular wait**, making the system **stuck** in the process. This website provides pretty much everything, from its **definition, detection, prevention, avoidance**, and others, which is why I like it.

8. [Bounded Buffer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/bounded-buffer)<br>
This is one of the problem in synchronization, which also called **producer consumer problem**. This occurs because there's a **limitation** in the way buffer works concurrently. The solution to this problem is by using **semaphores**. I really like this website content and style which is refreshing to my eyes.

9. [Peterson's Algorithm](https://www.cs.wcupa.edu/rkline/OS/Peterson.html)<br>
This is website that provides information about **Peterson's Algorithm**. Having a comperhensive explanation really helps me understand it. Besides that, it also provided with table representation which is making this website a helpful guide.

10. [Race Conditions and How to Prevent Them - A Look at Dekker's Algorithm](https://youtu.be/MqnpIwN7dz0)<br>
This is a YouTube video explaining about **Dekker's Algorithm** through **cute animation**. It may not be as comperhensive as other, but hey, it's really **good introduction** into synchronization (well at least for me).
